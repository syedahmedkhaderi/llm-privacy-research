# Research Log - [20 Feb 2026]

## Time Spent
- Total: 12 hours

## What I Worked On Today
- Reran Top-k ablation study du to inconsistencies
- Wrote complete research paper under 3 pages for the submission
- Run 1 config: {1. Baseline: 'canary_repetitions': [1, 5, 10, 20, 50] from 100 , 'num_canaries_per_type': 30 from 100}
                {2. RAG: num_canaries: 30 from 100 and num_samples = 100 from 250}
- Running 6 colab accounts at same time for top k to further verify results - failed
- Realized colab free limit isnt enough to run the ablation study with original configurations unless i reduce it.
- But reducing generates bad quality ablation study.
