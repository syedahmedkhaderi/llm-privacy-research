# Research Log - [20 Nov 2025]

## Time Spent
- Total: 2 hours

## What I Worked On Today
- found the errors in the code
- Apparently, it was the git clone in colab which wasnt cloning the file content properly creating errors.
- I had manually do it.

## What I Learned
- learned that errors could arise during git clone in colab and the file needs to be rechecked

## Problems I Encountered
- timewaste so far due to this issue
- stuck with unable to run chat-target.sh

## Solutions/Progress
- leanred a key error that could save lot of time in future

## Questions for Next Meeting
- 


## Tomorrow's Plan
- try running the chat-target.sh again
- check if there are any other issues
