# Research Log - [8 Nov 2025]

## Time Spent
- Total: 9 hours

## What I Worked On Today
- Tired running the code the whole day
- Not much improvements
- Still stuck in the first command

## What I Learned
- more about the repository and its dependencies

## Problems I Encountered
- countless stream of errors while running the first command in colab
- no dataset?
- super long wait time
- no way to download or preprocess thge personachat dataset so had to switch sst 
- but some code explicitly kept running personachat dataset and kept causing erros.

## Solutions/Progress
- found lots of bugs in the repository
- was able to run but failed after 4 hours of run.
- still not sure what is wrong with it.
- found a way to run sst2 but failed in 2nd epoch. Problem is some directory didnt exist or wasnt created

## Questions for Next Meeting
- is the repository full of bugs?
- Does the repository even work?


## Tomorrow's Plan
- feeling hopeless due to the countless errors and long wait times. 
- will try another approach tommorow and focus just on the first command. 
- MAybe i am missing the most obivous thing.
