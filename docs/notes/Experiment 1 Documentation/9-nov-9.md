## Time Spent
- Total: 5 hours

## What I Worked On Today

- I plotted 2 graphs. 
- Left out the model graph as the others took up all the time.
- Saved the plots in a folder called "plots" under the main directory.
- config.py file wasnt working no matter what so used config.yaml instead.

- Learned and completed the task. Now i just have to do the sorting part.

## Problems I Encountered
- Difficulty understanding the code

## Solutions/Progress
- Completed the task which felt impossible after 3 days of non stop effort and countless hours.
- Use Claude for understanding the code and generating the parts i didnt understand.
