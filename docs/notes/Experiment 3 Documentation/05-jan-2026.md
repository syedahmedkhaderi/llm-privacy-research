# Research Log - [5 Jan, 2026]

## Time Spent
- Total: 13 hours

## What I Worked On Today
- read the whole paper yesterday and took down notes
- create script again based on new configs.
- Compared same model both baseline and rag after attaining minor success on different
- attained better results
- will try for 50 canaries per type for better results
- if it doesnt work then ill try something else

## What I Did
- completed and proved 9.2% reduction for baseline - gpt 2 and rag - gbt neo
- completed n proved 23% reduction for baseline and rag - gbt neo
- tried with 50 num canaries and failed. Got opposite results by very low. 3.9%. Does increasing canary reduce reduce rag protection?
