# Research Log - [31 Dec, 2025 - 2 Jan, 2026]

## Time Spent
- Total: 3 days

## What I Worked On Today
- Fixed the errors and bugs in the script
- successfully ran it and obtained results

## What I Learned
- 

## Problems I Encountered
- Issue regarding baseline
- Enron attack result not as expected and need further check
- taking too long to run on T4
- vertex ai issue still not solved

## Solutions/Progress
- Reduce nun_samples to 100 from 250 and was able to run in 4-5 hours but errors persists and need further debugging
- Neo gbt model works as expected
- Experiment was a failure. I still obtained baseline results leaking less than RAG
- Am i forcing this? or does really reduce the leakage?
- I ll sleep now, its 3 am. Ill continue tomorrow morning
