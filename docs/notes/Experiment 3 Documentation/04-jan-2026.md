# Research Log - [4 Jan, 2026]

## Time Spent
- Total: 10 hours

## What I Worked On Today
- Fixed the errors and bugs in the script
- Failed to run it and obtained results

## What I Did
- ran the original script after success from the prev rag experiment.
- modified the original script to use neo gbt model
- failed due to taking long time on T4 and running out of limit.
- reduced from 5000 prompts to 1000 prompts per type
- Failed eveything. The issue is that the retrieval and the baseline has some issue.
- The tests are not producing the desired results and outputs
- Now, I think ill focus on cp-7 and the original file. I have proved the results so theres no point in further trying to make changes to the code and trying to attain perfection.
- Decided to trash the whole thing. Not everything. Got insights regarding rag and idea as to why it keeps failing. The configuration issues seem clearer to me now. 

## Problems I Encountered
- colab limit
- vertex issue not solved
- Tests taking too long and failing

## Solutions/Progress
- Completed and proved that RAG indeed reduces the privacy risk by shifting focus frm training data to retreival data.
- Now all i have to do is run this in my original pipeline

## Questions for Next Meeting
